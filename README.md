Improv is a site where users can create stories with one another.  Once a user logs in, they can choose to Create a new story or Add to an existing story. Once 5 people have contributed to a story, the story is complete.  Completed stories can be found on the main page.  There are 3 categories or stories to choose from: Story1(Once upon a time), Story2(I dont know about you, but I would never) and Story3(I'm hungry).
